## üíæ 1. PC Setup <a name = "pc_setup"></a>
#### 1.1 Personal PC Setup
During this class, we are going to use [Ubuntu 18.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as our main operating system. 

- If you already have **Ubuntu 16.04** insteaded, it is *preferable* to upgrade to 18.04 but *not necessary* to do so. 
- If you have a windows operating system, please follow [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB_5fqiysi4) to install **virtual box + ubuntu** on your system.(replace ubuntu *16.04* with *18.04*)
- **\[optional\]** If you have a windows 10 on your system. You call try out [Windows 10 Bash & Linux Subsystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvrqmq9A3tA&t=243s). it is a command line bash based system on windows, it has most function of Ubuntu, but it doesnt provide a GUI interface.(you can use **X Servers** to bypass it, but it is bugyy to use)

#### 1.2 Raspberry PI Setup
Since its not really a good idea to put your laptop/desktop on a *0.2m^3* robot, we are going to use *Raspberry Pi* as our ob board PC. 

- Raspberry Pi 3: Please follow [this video]() link to setup your raspberry pi
- Raspberry Pi 4: Since the offical Ubuntu support for raspberry pi 4 havent come out yet. You can install [Raspbian Buster with desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), the setup process would be the similar as above.
- **DVI type monitor Setup:** 
  ```
  sudo nano /boot/config.txt
  ```
  ```

## ‚úçÔ∏è 3. Notes <a name = "notes"></a>

- when using **catkin_make** on raspberry pi:
Use `catkin_make -j2` instead of `catkin_make`
  - *"-j2" means using 2 cores for computing.*
  - *Raspberry pi has 4 core process by default, if didn't use "-j2", it will use all 4 core process to compute, which may result in crash or froze.*
